Find the middle node of a given LinkedList. 
`Used two pointer approach` 
`Slow Pointer = node.next`, and 
`Fast pointer = node.next.next;` 
at each iteration check if any of the pointer equals to `null`
When fast pointer is null slow pointer will be at the middle node just print node.data to get the result.  
 

Print all the permutations of give string. 
There are two approaches for this either 
we can use `permute` library or 
we can code using loops in `O(n^2)`. 
 

Third last node of LinkedList, 
above mentioned two pointer approach will be used here as well. 

Difference between `call by value` and `call by reference`. 
In call by value, we pass the copy of variable in the function whereas 
in call by reference we pass the actual variable into the function. 
How we do that? We pass the memory address of that variable to the function. 
These concepts are used with pointers in C/C++. 

Difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript. 
Both are used for comparison 
double equal to is a content comparator whereas 
triple equals compares both content and data types of LHS & RHS. 

Difference between Breadth-first search & Depth first search.
